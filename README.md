# Python Programming
### Leonardo Masci

This is the repository for my ADM homework 1 (Hackerrank)

**Scripts.py**: 
In this file you will find all my solutions for the exercises. They are organised in the order they appear in on Hackerrank. They are numbered and divided into sections, for clarity. Problem 2 is found at the bottom, after Problem 1. All assigned exercises have been completed.

**Stamps folder**: 
In this folder you will find a pdf file containing screenshots from the Hackerrank website, proving all exercises work
